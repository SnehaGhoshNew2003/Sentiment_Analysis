# Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using deep learning models. The notebook processes textual data, tokenizes it, and applies a neural network to classify sentiment.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization and padding)
- Deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Train-test split for evaluation
- Dataset handling using pandas

## Requirements
Install the required dependencies before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install pandas tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sentiment_Analysis.git
cd Sentiment_Analysis
```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
```
3. Follow the notebook's instructions to preprocess data and train the model.

## Dataset
Ensure that the dataset is available in the correct path. Modify the notebook accordingly if needed.

## Results
The trained model provides predictions for sentiment classification. Evaluate the model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.
